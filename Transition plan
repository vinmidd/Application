Power BI Transition Plan

Date: Thursday, October 10, 2024
Time: 12:58 PM


---

1. Introduction

The purpose of this transition plan is to ensure a smooth migration and adaptation to the Power BI platform for reporting needs. This document covers the essential steps for transitioning reports, modifying existing reports, and ensuring data governance using Power BI.


---

2. Architecture

This section outlines the architecture that will support the Power BI implementation. The architecture will be the foundation for integrating various data sources, managing semantic models, and ensuring secure access to reports.
Key considerations include:

Data flow from source systems to Power BI

Server architecture

Role of gateways in connecting on-premises data



---

3. Reports (Scope, Demo of Lease Square Footage)

The scope of this section involves transitioning existing reports to Power BI. This includes a demonstration of the Lease Square Footage report to showcase how data is brought into Power BI, the different visuals created, and the interaction capabilities available in the report.
The transition will cover:

Visualizations and charts

Dynamic filtering and interaction capabilities

Accessibility across devices



---

4. Key Data Sources – Bringing Data into Power BI Reports

Identifying and integrating the key data sources that will feed into Power BI is a critical part of this transition. This section focuses on:

Understanding which databases, spreadsheets, or external APIs are involved

Importing data into Power BI through scheduled refreshes or live connections

Maintaining data accuracy and timeliness across reports



---

5. Users of the Report – Distribution of the Report

This section describes the end-users of the reports and the methods of report distribution. It involves:

Identifying user groups or departments that require access to specific reports

Managing user access through security roles and permissions in Power BI

Methods of report distribution, including sharing via Power BI Service, embedding reports, or exporting reports in various formats



---

New Report Creation – For Transition

1. Sample Report Creation (Excel and Database)
A step-by-step guide on creating new reports from scratch using data from Excel files and databases. This involves setting up data connections, building the necessary data models, and creating visualizations.


2. Semantic Model Layer & Report
The creation of a semantic model that abstracts the underlying data, making it easier for end-users to interact with the data. This involves defining measures, hierarchies, and relationships within the dataset.


3. GitHub Version Control
Using GitHub to manage version control of reports and datasets. This ensures that changes are tracked, and multiple users can collaborate on report development without losing progress or causing inconsistencies.


4. Manually Publish Report to Workspace & Update App
Instructions on how to manually publish reports to a workspace in Power BI and update corresponding Power BI apps for users. This step ensures that reports are available to all users with the latest changes.


5. Data Gateway Refresh
Setting up a data gateway for reports that require on-premises data access. This step is crucial for ensuring that data is kept up-to-date without manual intervention.


6. Access of the Report
A detailed explanation of how users can access reports, including through Power BI Desktop, Power BI Service, and mobile apps. It also covers how permissions are managed and how reports are shared securely.

Modifying and Maintaining Existing Reports

1. Change/Modify Report (Excel and Database)
Instructions on modifying existing reports, whether the data source is an Excel file, a database, or another format. This involves updating data connections, refreshing visuals, and ensuring data accuracy.


2. Semantic Model Layer & Report
Modifying the semantic model layer to reflect changes in the underlying data or business requirements. This includes adding new measures, updating relationships, and refining the model for better performance.


3. GitHub Version Control
Using GitHub to manage changes to reports over time. This section emphasizes the importance of maintaining version control and collaboration when multiple users are working on report modifications.


4. Manually Publish Report to Workspace & Update App
After modifying a report, this section explains the steps needed to manually publish it to the Power BI workspace and update any associated Power BI apps, ensuring that users always have the latest version of the report.


5. Data Gateway Refresh
Maintaining and updating the data gateway to ensure continuous access to on-premises data. This includes troubleshooting any issues with data refreshes and ensuring timely updates to reports.




---

This detailed plan outlines the transition process, ensuring that both new and existing reports are effectively managed in Power BI while maintaining data integrity and user access. By following these steps, the transition will be smooth, and reports will remain reliable and accessible.
