Components and Their Roles:
End User (Business People):

The primary users who will interact with the chatbot to reserve meeting rooms.
Office Admin:

The personnel responsible for organizing meeting room logistics, who will receive notifications via the SharePoint ticketing system.
Microsoft Teams Channel:

The primary interface for users to interact with the chatbot, deeply integrated into their daily workflow. The chatbot will appear as a Teams app.
Custom Web Interface (Optional but Recommended):

Provides an alternative, dedicated web portal for chatbot interaction, offering more control over UI/UX compared to Teams' native bot interface. This could be a simple React/Angular/Vue.js application hosted on Azure Static Web Apps or Azure App Service.
Azure Bot Service:

The central orchestration layer for the chatbot.
Handles channel integration (Teams, Web Chat), managing conversation state, and routing user messages.
Acts as the intermediary between the user interface and the backend logic.
Provides built-in capabilities for authentication, security, and scalability.
LLM (Azure OpenAI Service / Google Gemini Pro):

Intent Recognition & Entity Extraction: The LLM will process natural language input from users to understand their intent (e.g., "book a room," "check availability," "cancel reservation") and extract key entities (date, time, duration, location, attendees, required gadgets, special requests).
Conversational Flow Management: Can guide the conversation, clarify ambiguities, and provide helpful responses based on the context.
Fallback & Generative Responses: Can generate more human-like responses for complex queries or when specific structured data isn't found.
Azure Functions (or other Serverless Compute):

The core backend logic for the chatbot.
API Gateway/Wrapper: Acts as an intermediary, abstracting the complexities of interacting directly with TRIRIGA and SharePoint APIs.
Business Logic: Contains the code to:
Validate user input.
Call TRIRIGA APIs to search for available rooms, book reservations, or manage existing reservations.
Call SharePoint APIs to create new tickets in the "IT Central Ticketing System" list, populating it with all necessary details (room, date, time, organizer, gadgets, special requests, TRIRIGA reservation ID).
Handle OAuth authentication flows with TRIRIGA.
Orchestrate the overall interaction based on the intent identified by the LLM.
Scalability: Azure Functions are serverless, scaling automatically based on demand, perfect for the "200 users per day" requirement.
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):

User Authentication & SSO: Leveraged by Azure Bot Service and Azure Functions for secure user authentication (Single Sign-On) via OAuth. This ensures the chatbot knows who the user is and can authorize their actions against TRIRIGA.
User Information: Can provide user details (name, email, potentially office location if mapped) to the chatbot and backend.
IBM TRIRIGA System:

The authoritative source for meeting room data and reservation management.
TRIRIGA APIs: The documented APIs will be used by Azure Functions to interact with TRIRIGA.
SharePoint Site / IT Central Ticketing System:

The destination for notifications to office admins.
SharePoint APIs: Used by Azure Functions to programmatically create list items (tickets) in the designated SharePoint list, triggering existing workflows.
High-Level Flow:
User Initiates Conversation: A user types a request in Microsoft Teams (e.g., "Book a meeting room for tomorrow morning for 5 people in New York, I need a projector").
Azure Bot Service Receives Input: The message is sent to the Azure Bot Service.
LLM Processes Intent: The Azure Bot Service forwards the message to the LLM (Azure OpenAI). The LLM identifies the user's intent (e.g., BookRoom) and entities (e.g., date: tomorrow, time: morning, attendees: 5, location: New York, gadget: projector).
Azure Functions for Business Logic: The Azure Bot Service, based on the identified intent, calls the appropriate Azure Function.
Azure AD Authentication: The Azure Function authenticates the user against Azure AD to identify them (user@customer.com).
TRIRIGA Interaction:
The Azure Function constructs a query to the TRIRIGA API to search for available rooms based on the extracted entities.
If rooms are found, the chatbot presents options to the user.
Once the user selects a room and confirms, the Azure Function makes another call to the TRIRIGA API to create the reservation.
SharePoint Notification:
After successful booking in TRIRIGA, the Azure Function makes a call to the SharePoint API.
It creates a new item (ticket) in the "IT Central Ticketing System" SharePoint list, populating it with all relevant reservation details (room, date, time, organizer, gadgets, special requests, TRIRIGA reservation ID).
This action triggers the existing SharePoint workflow to notify the appropriate office admin(s).
Chatbot Confirmation: The Azure Function sends a confirmation message back to the Azure Bot Service, which then relays it to the user in Teams (e.g., "Your meeting room 'Conference Room Alpha' is booked... A ticket has been created for the office admin (Ticket ID: SP-12345)").
This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for your chatbot, leveraging Microsoft's cloud ecosystem for seamless integration with Teams and Azure AD, while connecting to your on-premise TRIRIGA system. We can deep dive into each of these components and their specific configurations in the next steps.
