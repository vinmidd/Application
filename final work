Okay, let's make this presentation visually engaging! Here are some ideas for visuals and charts to enhance each slide:
Slide 1: Title Slide
	•	Visual: A professional, high-quality image related to technology, data, or project delivery. Consider a blurred background image with the title text overlaid for a modern look.
	•	Chart/Graph: Not applicable for a title slide.
Slide 2: Executive Summary
	•	Visual: Use icons to represent each of the key bullet points. For example, a rocket for "high-impact," a gear for "system performance," a shield for "reduced technical debt," and a building foundation for "future scalability."
	•	Chart/Graph: Not applicable for an executive summary, but consider a simple progress bar to visually represent the overall project completion.
Slide 3: Scope of Delivery
	•	Visual: A flowchart or process diagram to illustrate the different components of the delivery. Use distinct colors and shapes to differentiate each deliverable.
	•	Chart/Graph: A simple bar chart could show the percentage of each deliverable completed.
Slide 4: Delivery Highlights
	•	Visual: Icons can again be effective here. Consider a clock for "timely delivery," a handshake for "collaboration," a checklist for "adherence to best practices," and a shield for "proactive risk management."
	•	Chart/Graph: A radar chart could be used to show the "score" for each delivery highlight, allowing for a quick visual comparison.
Slide 5: Key Fixes and Enhancements
	•	Visual: Before/After sliders or side-by-side comparisons can be very effective here. Use screenshots or diagrams to show the difference.
	•	Chart/Graph: For the SQL Agent Job Reengineering, a line graph showing the reduction in job failures over time would be impactful.
Slide 6: Automation & Integration Delivered
	•	Visual: Network diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate the data flow for each integration (KLI, Store Strategy, IQVIA, Location Alignment API). Use arrows to show the direction of data.
	•	Chart/Graph: For each integration, consider a simple table or bar chart showing the quantifiable benefits (e.g., hours saved, improved data freshness).
Slide 7: Technical Infrastructure Improvements
	•	Visual: Diagrams of the system architecture before and after the improvements. This could include server diagrams or network maps.
	•	Chart/Graph: For the Mercury DB Refresh, a bar chart showing the reduction in refresh time.
Slide 8: Before vs After Snapshot
	•	Visual: This slide is already well-structured as a table. Consider using color-coding (e.g., green for positive changes, red for negative - if any - changes). Use icons to represent each area (e.g., a gear for SQL Agent Jobs, a database icon for Store Strategy).
	•	Chart/Graph: The "Impact" column could be visualized with small bar charts or icons representing the magnitude of the impact.
Slide 9: Value Delivered
	•	Visual: Use icons to represent each value delivered (e.g., a speedometer for "faster data pipelines," a hand for "reduction in manual interventions," a magnifying glass for "improved data accuracy," a building for "foundation for future growth," and a shield for "reduced technical debt").
	•	Chart/Graph: A spider chart could be used to show the relative impact of each value delivered.
Slide 10: Next Steps / Recommendations
	•	Visual: Use a roadmap or timeline to illustrate the next steps. Icons can also be used to represent each recommendation.
	•	Chart/Graph: Not directly applicable, but consider a simple bar chart to show the potential ROI of each recommendation.
Slide 11: Thank You
	•	Visual: A professional image related to teamwork or collaboration.
	•	Chart/Graph: Not applicable.
Remember to keep the design clean and consistent throughout the presentation. Use a consistent color palette, font style, and layout. Avoid overcrowding slides with too much text or too many visuals. The visuals should enhance the message, not distract from it.
